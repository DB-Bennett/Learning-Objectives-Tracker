Project: My Learning Objectives Tracker
This project provides a foundational SQL database schema and data scripts for a personal learning and achievement tracker. The database is designed to help you organize, track, and showcase your professional development journey by linking learning objectives to a wide range of accomplishments, from degrees to projects.

Database Schema
The schema uses a relational model to ensure data integrity and flexibility. The core tables are LearningObjectives and Achievements, which are linked by a junction table to support a many-to-many relationship. This allows a single learning objective to be tied to multiple achievements (e.g., a "Learn Data Science" objective could lead to multiple certificates and a project), and an achievement (e.g., a "Master's Degree") could fulfill multiple learning objectives.

Table Descriptions:
AchievementTypes: A lookup table to categorize achievements (e.g., 'Certificate', 'Degree', 'Project').

LearningObjectives: Stores the details of each learning objective, including a status (Ongoing or Completed).

Achievements: The central table for all your accomplishments, with a foreign key linking to the AchievementTypes table.

ObjectiveAchievements: The junction table that connects LearningObjectives to Achievements.

GitHub Project Structure
To create the GitHub repository for this project, follow these steps to organize your files. This structure is designed to keep your project clear, professional, and easy for others to navigate.

Create a Repository: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub named Learning-Objectives-Tracker.

Add Key Directories: Inside your repository, create the following two main directories:

sql/: This will contain all your SQL scripts.

docs/: This will house all your project-related documents.

Create SQL Files: In the sql/ directory, create the following files:

schema.sql: Contains the commands to build the database structure.

data.sql: Contains the sample data to populate the tables.

Create Documentation Files: In the docs/ directory, create the following markdown files:

project_report.md: A detailed report or essay about the project, including the problem statement, solution, key findings, and future enhancements.

presentation_links.md: A separate file for links to any external presentations (e.g., Google Slides, PowerPoint) or data analysis spreadsheets (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) related to the project.

interview_notes.md: A concise summary of the project, perfect for preparing for interviews or quick overviews.

Create the README: In the root of your repository, create the README.md file. This is your project's main landing page and should provide an overview, setup instructions, and an explanation of the files.
